This project was built with IntelliJ IDEA. You can run the files
from IDEA by adding the jar files in lib to classpath and running main() in
src/main/java/Launcher. Iâ€™ve included external libraries via jar files (I did
not use maven).

You can run the project from the command line by navigating to
out/production/MitchellCodingChallenge and running:

java -cp .:../../../lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.40-bin.jar main/java/Launcher

To store data, I used MYSQL. You can edit the properties in
src/main/resources/mitchellcc.properties to configure the database
used and the username/password associated with it.

JUnit tests are also included in src/test. If you have IntelliJ you can add
the src/test folder to a test run configuration to run tests.

You can run the tests from the command line by navigating to
out/production/MitchellCodingChallenge and running:

java -cp .:../../../lib/junit-4.12.jar:../../../lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore test.java.data.dao.VehicleDAOTest

By editing the command above, you can run different test files.
e.g. test.java.data.utils.DataUtilsTest

As for optional requirements:
Validation of model, make, and year fields are supported.
Filtering of GET operation is also supported.
